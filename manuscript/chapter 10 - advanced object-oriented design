# Advanced Object-Oriented Design

## Quick Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Go
    	- Structs and Methods
    	- Visibility
    	- The Receiver

## Struct Embedding


### Unnamed Struct Field

### Poorman's Inheritance

### Multiple inheritance

### Pointer Embedding

## SOLID design in Go

### Single Responsibility Principle

### Open / Closed Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Interface Segregation Principle

### Dependency Inversion Principle

## Interfaces FTW
- Primary Abstraction Mechanism
- Duck interfaces
## The WINIWYG principle
		- Dependency injection a.k.a 3rd party binding
## Factories
	    - Singletons
## Data-only structs
- No methods
- Fields may contain any object
- Prefer primitive types, standard library types and interfaces
## Modeling your domain
- Primary Entities - User, Link and Tag
- Primary operations
## Object-oriented Design in Go vs. Other Languages

### Go vs. C
- Go structs vs. C structs

### Go vs. C++
- Go interfaces vs. struct with pure virtual functions

### Go vs. Java/C#
- Go empty interface vs. Java/C# Object

### Go vs. Python
- Go packages vs. Python namespaces
