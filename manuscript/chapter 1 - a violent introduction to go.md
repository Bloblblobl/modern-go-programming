# A Violent Introduction to Go

I called this chapter originally "A Taste of Go". I wasn't sure if I should capitalize or not the 
"A" at the beginning so I ran a quick DuckDuckGo search and what do you know? There is a famous
talk called [A Taste of Go](https://talks.golang.org/2014/taste.slide). I even remember going over 
it back in the day and liking the name. Well, I couldn't use it anymore. I thought of "
Gentle Introdcution to Go", but that's super boring. Then, let's go for the other extreme - 
a violent and brutal intro! You're welcome!

What happens here? First I'll show you the Go playground where you can quickly write, compile and 
run Go code in your browser. Then, I'll tell you what makes Go special, a little about Go's hisotry,
mention some prominent Go users, talk a bit about the community and finally introduce the sample
application we will buuild together troughout the book (if you stick around).
