# Generic Programming in Go
	- Built-in generic containers
	- The empty interface
		- An interface is a pointer
		- Objects that operate at the generic level
		- Using an empty interface
		- Interfaces with empty interface arguments and specialized implementations
	
	- Code Generation of specialized containers
	- Build your own set
		- Set of empty interfaces
		- Set with generic interface and specialized implementations
			- The Set interface accepts empty interface
			- No type-safety
			- Need to cast
		- Generating strongly-typed sets
			- All the benefits
			- Need to use a code generator
