This chapter means business. I kid you not! You will get to see all the building blocks of programming, see where Go stands on the shoulders of giants and where it decided to add its own variation on a theme. The topics we will cover are:
 
 - Naming of different entities such as files, types and variables
 - How does assignment work in Go
 - The Coolness that is Type Inference
 - Controlling the flow of your program with conditions and switching
 - Looping and Iterations
